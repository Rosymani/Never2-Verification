Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning technique in which agent learns to make decisions in an environment by interacting with it and receving feed back in the form of rewards or penalities. There are five classic control policies :-
 1. Acrobot -v1
 2. Cartpole -v1
 3. Mountain Car -v0
 4. Mountain Car Continous -v0
 5. Pendulum -v1
 
Project 1: Mountain Car -v0


The Classic control file consists of three types of coding files

(i) Basic.py  
    The code above is an implementation of a reinforcement learning problem using the OpenAI Gym library. Specifically, the MountainCar-v0 environment is used, which is a classic problem in the field of reinforcement learning. The main loop of the code is executed for a total of 40 episodes. Within each episode, the environment is reset and the initial state is obtained. Then, a while loop is executed until the episode is complete, which is determined by the "done" variable. In each iteration of the while loop, the current state is rendered, an action is selected from the action space using the ".sample()" method, and the next state, reward, done, and info are obtained by calling the ".step(action)" method of the environment. The total reward for the episode is updated by adding the reward obtained in the current step. Finally, the current state is updated to the next state.

This code provides a simple example of how to interact with the MountainCar-v0 environment in OpenAI Gym and implement a random policy to solve the problem

(ii) Q learn.py
  
   The code implements the Q-learning algorithm for the MountainCar-v0 environment in the OpenAI Gym library. The goal of the agent is to drive an underpowered car up a steep mountain road. The agent receives a reward of -1 at each time step until it reaches the goal, which is defined as reaching the flag at the top of the mountain. The agent also receives a penalty of -100 if it takes more than 200 steps to reach the goal. The Q-learning algorithm is a model-free, off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that learns to estimate the optimal action-value function by iteratively updating the Q-values for each state-action pair. The algorithm starts by initializing the Q-table with random values and then iteratively updates the Q-values using the Bellman equation, which relates the Q-value of a state-action pair to the Q-values of the next state and the next possible actions. The Q-value update is performed using the Q-learning rule, which selects the action that maximizes the Q-value for the next state.

   The code uses an epsilon-greedy strategy to choose actions, which selects a random action with probability epsilon and the action with the highest Q-    value with probability 1-epsilon. The code also uses a custom reward function that penalizes the agent for taking too long to reach the goal.The code initializes the Q-table based on the size of the state space, which is discretized into a grid of 10 x 100 cells. The code also defines a function to convert the continuous observation space of the environment into discrete state indices.The main training loop iteratively updates the Q-table for each episode by selecting actions, taking them in the environment, and updating the Q-values using the Q-learning rule. The loop terminates when the agent reaches the goal or takes more than 200 steps. After training, the code evaluates the agent by running a single episode and selecting actions based on the highest Q-value.




(iii) Q learning Neural network.py

The above code is an implementation of the Q-learning algorithm using Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) to train an agent to solve the MountainCar-v0 environment in OpenAI Gym. The agent learns to control a car to reach the top of a hill while overcoming the force of gravity. The DQN model is implemented using Keras and the Adam optimizer. The model consists of three fully connected layers, with ReLU activation functions in the first two layers and linear activation function in the output layer. The loss function used is mean squared error (MSE), and the target values are calculated using the Bellman equation.

The agent uses an epsilon-greedy policy, with epsilon initialized to 1.0 and decayed over time to encourage exploration in the early stages of learning. The agent stores the experiences of its interaction with the environment in a memory buffer, and a random sample of experiences is used to train the DQN model in batches. The replay function uses advanced indexing to update the Q-values of the actions taken and trains the model on the updated Q-values.

The agent's performance is evaluated over 100 episodes, and the scores are plotted to visualize the agent's learning progress. The training process can take some time, but the agent can eventually learn to solve the environment by reaching the top of the hill within the maximum number of allowed steps. The code also includes a random policy function to compare the performance of the DQN agent with a random agent that selects actions randomly, without learning from previous experiences.

(iv) Pytorch.py

The above code The random-policy function demonstrates a random policy where the agent
takes random actions in the environment, serving as a baseline for compari-
son against the DQN’s learned policy.The main execution block initializes the
MountainCar-v0 environment, creates an instance of the DQNAgent, and trains
the agent using the train-dqn function. The training progress is visualized by
plotting the scores achieved in each episode.
This code leverages PyTorch to implement a DQN for solving the MountainCar-
v0 task, demonstrating the key components of a reinforcement learning system,
including neural network architecture, experience replay, and epsilon-greedy ex-
ploration. The agent learns to navigate the environment and achieve the goal
state through iterative training episodes. The resulting plot provides insights
into the learning progress, showcasing the agent’s ability to accumulate rewards
